# OneButtonGame
Git repo for the one button game

As of 13/05/2024 I (Owen) have created a default import preset for all sprites so long as they are PNGs
If you are importing a single sprite, just name it whatever you like, the project is only looking for the ".png" extension
If you are importing a sprite sheet, make sure the name ends with "Sprite.png" as this is what the engine looks for to apply the preset
When importing sprite sheets, you do still have to slice the sprites and add physics shapes yourself, but the engine will automatically adjust the compression settings
